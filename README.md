## Misc. Notes
- can't put everything on one side, not enough pins on 3.3V side without using the UART pins
- enabling the watchdog creates problems when trying to push new firmware the watchdog resets it. 
- Yellow, red, white are probably the best colors. Blue is hard to read with the white outlines.
